<h2><b>How (not) to create a website</b></h2>
<br></br>

<p>I chose to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to create my fabacademy pages, as several online reviews pointed to it as a powerful and easy-to-use static website builder. </p>


<p>There were a few hickups before I could start playing with it: I had to update my OS to the latest <i>Yosemite</i>, and then install Homebrew, Xcode, Ruby, RubyGems and Node JS.  I also took some time to learn some of Terminal's basic commands, since I had seldom used it.</p>  

<p>Several tutorials later, everything was finally installed and I was ready to start making my Jekyll webiste. Everything seemed pretty straightforward and I soon had a website with working pages for each weekly assignment.</p>

<p>Jekyll's default layout is quite basic so I thought I should try to tweak the html code a bit...and this was when the problems started...finding the html code for each page element was not such a trivial task, as all you you see in the html files in it's template directory is stuff like this:</p>

<br></br>

<p>Time was running short and I decided to just settle with the basic template (and even here, still struggling with a stubborn auto-generated navigation bar).  <a href"=http://fabacademy.org/archives/2013/students/carvao.luis/index.html">Lu√≠s</a> was getting ready to test uploading the site to the fabacademy's archive. And that's when we realized there was another problem:</p>

<br></br>
<p>Gigantic grey bars had grown on my homepage! I decided to have Jekyll build another site with a different bootstrap template (one I have not touched and destroyed, I thought) to see if that one came out ok. this is how it looked before and after Jekyll "built it":</p>

<br></br>
<p>At this point, I decided to kill Jekyll once and for all -- it's clearly not as easy as they say.</p>

<p>At the end, I just downloaded a simple bootstrap template tweaked bits of its html and css and pasted my content on it. I think soon I'll be giving <a href"=http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>
 a try.

      <p>New panels, list groups, glyphicons and justified navigation.</p>
      
      <h4>Less Bloat</h4>
      <p>The optimized CSS is in a single file. Glyphicons are now separate.</p>
