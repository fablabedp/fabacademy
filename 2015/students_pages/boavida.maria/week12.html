       <h3>week 12: composites</h3>
      


<h2><b>Multi-fiber bowl</b></h2>
<br></br>

  <div class="container"> 


<p>Our task this week was to make a fiber composite with a light and strong structure.</p>

<p>I decided to try out a bunch of different fiber combinations, to see how they would behave with the resin. So I picked some burlap, pieces of old jeans and a thin cotton fabric for my tests. </p>

<p>The recommended resin for this assignment was <a href="http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/pdfs/Entropy/Super_Sap_One_TDS.pdf">Entropy Resins Supersap</a>, which is a slightly more sustainable binder than the usual epoxy, polyurethane and polyester resins available in the market.</p>

<p>I also decided to try out different release agents for my composite: mold release from Smooth-On, vaseline and food film.</p>

 <br></br>


<p>COUPON MAKING</p>

<p>I started by preparing five different coupons:</p>

<p>- 1 with 2 plies of jeans (vaseline release)</p>
<p>- 1 with 3 plies of jeans (smooth-on mold release)</p>
<p>- 1 with 2 plies of burlap</p>
<p>- 1 with 2 plies of burlap and cardboard inbetween</p>
<p>- 1 with 4 plies of cotton fabric</p>


 <img src="images/coupon_prep.jpg">
 <br></br>

 <p>I carefully mixed the 2 parts of the resin (50/50 ratio in volume) and stirred the mix for a good 2-3 minutes.</p>

 <br></br>

<p>I then applied the resin to the pieces of cloth with a spatula.</p>

 <br></br>

<p>Once all the pieces were soaked in the resin, I added a breeder layer on top. I used 2 different types of breeder material, to see which worked best. On some I used food film on which I made a ton of little holes; on others, I used sewing buckram (a somewhat stiff, perfurated fabric), sprayed with Smooth On mold release.  I then added a layer of sewing batter to absorb the excess resin and put the coupons in the vacuum bag, which was connected to the air compressor. I left the coupons in the bag overnight.</p>

 <br></br>
<p>The next day, I de-bagged the coupons to see how well they had cured.</p>

    <img src="images/coupon_suck2.jpg">
 <br></br>

<p>Although they were no longer sticky, they were clearly not hard enough. </p>

    <img src="images/coupon_open.jpg">
 <br></br>

 <p>I peeled off the breeder and bleeder layers and (most of) the food film and trimmed some of the coupon's edges. Then I put them in the oven, for faster curing.</p>

     <img src="images/coupon_peeloff.jpg">
 <br></br>
     
      <img src="images/edge_trim.jpg">
 <br></br>

 <p>I left them in the oven at 30ºC for about three hours. </p>

     <img src="images/coupons_oven.jpg">
 <br></br>
<p>After that, the composite was harder but still flexible -- clearly still not fully cured (!). I trimmed off some edges and put the coupons back in the oven. This time I left them one hour at 44ºC and two hours at 55ºC.</p>

 <br></br>

<p>The next day, my coupons were a bit harder, but still not completely stiff.

 <br></br>

<p>So I moved on to make my final piece - a burlap bowl with an outside layer of cotton fabric. </p>
  
<p>COMPOSITE BOWL:

<p>I started by cutting my mold tool. I lasercut several oval pieces of MDF in different sizes. </p>

     <img src="images/toolmaking.jpg">

 <br></br>
<p>And then I glued them all together for my bowl structure.</p>

 <br></br>

<p>Then I lasercut my fibers. The cotton fabric pieces were ready in no time, but I had a little trouble with the burlap. I didn't place it properly on the laser's table, so it caught fire around the edges (which I should have trimmed), where the fibers are looser. I decided to wet the burlap with some water and try again. This time the laser cut it without a problem.</p>

<p>I then applied the resin to the fiber pieces and placed them on top of the tool. </p>

 <br></br>


<p>I added the bleeder and breeder layers (this time I used the "proper" breeder film -- it works as well as the buckram sprayed with mold release, definitely works better than the food film with punched holes).</p>

 <br></br>

<p>I put the bowl inside the vacuum bag, and after a couple of minutes the resin started to bleed. Once again, I left the compressor sucking the bag's air all night long.<p>

 <br></br>

<p>And the next day again...my composite was soft, clearly not completely cured! I put it in the oven at 50ºC for a few more hours, hoping the curing process will speed up.</p>

<p>tic-tac tic-tac tic-tac......</p>


<p>UPDATE: Five days later, the composite is still pretty soft...! I'm starting to think that the resin will never cure</p>
