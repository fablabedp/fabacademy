       <h3>week 13: networking & communications  </h3>
      

<h2><b>buses, bridges and nodes</b></h2>
<br></br>

  <div class="container"> 


 <p>This week, our task was to design and build a wired or wireless network connecting at least two processors. </p>

 <p>I chose to make a serial network and started by designing the bridge and node circuits, taking Neil's model as an example. </p>

 	<br></br>

<p>After fiddling around with EAGLE, I thought my boards looked similar enough to Neil's, so I got ready to export the .png files. I did a DRC check to see if there were overlaps, but all was clear. I drew thinner routes this time around (with a width of 0.012, when I had previously drawn them with 0.016), to make sure I would have less overlap issues than last time. I seemed to have worked, I thought.</p>

<p>The milled boards looked ok at first glance.</p>

 	<br></br>	

<p>And yet, there were quite a few problems with them. Basically, the millbit (1/64 inches) didn't cut through all the paths, so a lot of routes were not separated. I had to manually cut these routes with an exacto knife (5 out of 6 came out ok, the 6th one...was so hurt that I had to put some scotch tape on it to maintain the contact)</p>

 <p><b>MOUNTING & BAKING THE BOARDS</p></b>

  <p>I was now ready to mount the components on my circuit. </p>

  <img src="images/soldertable_setup.png">
 	<br></br>

  <p>For some strange reason, the solder mask I had made with the vinyl cutter was a bit bigger than the real board, so I ended up having to paste each pad manually, with the help of a needle and an exacto knife. It was not as hard as I thought, though and the three boards were ready in less than half hour.</p>

 	<br></br>

  <p>Since I didnt have the heat gun available this week, I decided to try baking my circuits in the oven. I found an old toaster oven and looked through this sites for instructions on oven-baked circuits:</p>

<a href="http://www.freetronics.com.au/pages/surface-mount-soldering-with-a-toaster-oven#.VUjM8tNViko">Surface mount soldering with a toaster oven</a></p>

 <p>The info on this page is detailed and straightforward, but the temperatures mentioned were way too low for the solder paste I was using. After looking at the <a href="http://jfsolder.com/product-3-6-sn62pb36ag2-tin-lead-solder-paste-en/146127">datasheet </a>, I realized the melting temperature of my paste was 183ºC. I set the oven for 190ºC (and later on turned it up to 220ºC).  </p>

<img src="images/setup_oven.png">
 	<br></br> 
 <p>I didn't have a termometer to check the oven's real temperature, so I put a test PCB with a solder drop in to see the result. After 3m40, the magic started to happen and the paste turned all shinny. I took it out and I put in a second test PCB, this time with a component attached. This time, after 4min10 at (what-the-oven-claims-to-be 220º), the solder was shinny and the component attached to the board.</p>

 	<img src="images/solder_oventest.png">
 	<br></br> 
 
 <p>I then carefully placed all the components on my boards and started to baked them, one by one. The baking time oscilated between 3:45 and 4:10. Once I saw the paste turn silver, I opened the oven's door and let it sit there for about a minute (sudden temperature drop is apparently not great for the solder paste).</p>

	<br></br>

 <p>And just like that, in 20 minutes all my boards were sucessfully baked! </p>


<p><b>PROGRAMMING THE BRIDGE </b></p>

<p>It was now time to start programming them. </p>

<img src="images/ready_to_program.png">
 	<br></br>

<p>I downloaded Neil's "fixed code" from the <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/content/tutorials/akf/networking_serial_bus.html">Providence tutorials</a> and tried loading it into the bridge board with my ISP.</p>


<p>The bridge board was not charged the first time around, so the AVRdude failed in loading the code.</p>

<img src="images/program_fail.jpg">
 	<br></br>

<p>After charging both boards, I tried programming the bridge again. </p>
 	
<img src="images/loading_code.jpg">
 	<br></br>

<p>This time, it worked just fine, and the AVRdude showed me a happy message at the end:</p>

<img src="images/program_success.jpg">
 	<br></br>



<p>I then removed the ISP and plugged the bridge circuit directly to the computer.</p>

<p>I typed "sudo dmesg" on terminal, a helpful command when diagnosing or debugging hardware and device driver issues. I could now to see the log of all parts connected with the computer and my bridge was listed, yay! </p>

<p>I opened Arduino IDE and found its serial port in the Tool menu: usbserial-A10137RD. Sadly, as I keyed in 0 in the serial port window (9600 baud), the LED on my circuit didn't blink.</p> 

 <img src="images/serial_port_window.jpg">
 	<br></br>

<p>I re-checked the circuit connections with the voltmeter and as I touched the RX pin, the bridge board started to send me some a message.</p>
<img src="images/bridge_feedback.png">
 	<br></br>

<p>My bridge board was connected. Now I had to figure out why the LED refused to blink...I decided to leave that check for after I programmed the two nodes.</p>


<p><b>PROGRAMMING THE NODES</p></b>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to sucessfully program the node boards, as I still needed to do some last-minute "fixing" - a couple of components were slightly out of place as they went in the oven and I had to de-solder and re-solder them first.</p> 

<p>I have tried loading them with Neil's code, but no success thus far...</p>

<p>(to be continued...)</p>
