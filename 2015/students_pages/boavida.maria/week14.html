       <h3>week 14: interface and application programming  </h3>
      

<h2><b>sonar magic</b></h2>
<br></br>

  <div class="container"> 

  
 <p>This week, the assignment was to write an application that interfaces with an input &/or output device. </p>


 <p>I chose to take the sonar sensor I made for input week and use <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> to make an interface for it.

 <img src="images/sonar_setup.jpg">
 <br></br> 

  <p>I used <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Arduino-and-HC-SR04-Example/?ALLSTEPS">this instructable</a> as an example: </p>

 <p>Since I had not managed to successfully finish programming part, I first had to get that out of the way. The ISP pins on my TXRX circuit were a bit damaged and I couldnt' get constant. So I decided to unsolder the ISP header and put jumpers on every pin (I din't have more headers on me at the time). </p> 

<img src="images/txrx_board.png">
 <br></br> 

 <p>I carefully connected the ISP to the TXRX board and tried programming it with avrdude. On my first try, I got this: </p>

<img src="images/program_fail1.jpg">
 <br></br> 

<p>I re-connected the ISP to the TXRX with even more care (pressing the jumpers a bit  as I sent the code, to ensure there was contact with all pads) and tried again. No luck.</p>

<p>I tried unplugging the sonar sensor from the TXRX, before programming it. And this time, the avrdude was able to do his job:</p>

 <br></br> 

<p><b>BURNING THE BOOTLOADER</p></b>

<p>My circuit was now programmed and yet I was unable compile my arduino sonar sketch, so I decided to try burning the bootloader on the Arduino IDE, and then try compiling the sketch again. Burning the bootloader was not working either, until I realized I should unplug my sonar sensor, before compiling the sketch. This time, it worked just fine.</p>

 <img src="images/burn_bootloader.png">
 <br></br> 

<p> But suddenly at this point, the TXRX board fell on the floor and got seriously hurt. Since I couldn't mill my PCB again on time for this assignment, I decided to just plug the sonar to an arduino and move on with the Processing part.</p> 

 
  <p><b>PROCESSING</p></b>


 <p>I used Processing for the interface part of my project. </p>


 <p> I started by watching quite a few Processing tutorials by the Plethora Project and those were quite helpful:  </p>

<a href="http://www.plethora-project.com/2011/09/12/processing-tutorials/">Plethora project -- Processing tutorials</a> <p>


<p>Here is a useful  <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">list of all the main commands in Processing</a> <p>

<p>And here is useful info on <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing/to-processing">how to connect Arduino to Processing. </a> <p>

 <p>I started by drawing simple objects and moving them around, changing color, size etc.</p>

 	<br></br> 


 <p><b>MAIN PROCESSING COMMANDS</p></b>


 <p>Placing info above setup/draw --- it becomes part of the global library, which can be accessed anywhere in the script.

 <p>Two main commands:</p>

 <p>void setup -- command to be run once at the beginning</p>
   
 <p>void draw -- commands that relate to the animation </p>

<p>Other useful commands:</p>

  <p>mouseX and mouseY (as replacement for static positioning coordinates)</p>
  <p>smooth</p>
  <p>map</p>
  <p>val</p>
  <p>println</p>
  <p>string</p>
  <p>speed</p>

<p>Different types of variables one can use to make animation:</p>

  <p>integers (int) - for whole numbers   ex:    int x = 5;</p>
  <p>floats - for decimal numbers         ex:    float y = 3.2;</p>
  <p>strings - a way of storing an array of characters</p>


<p>This was the first sucessfull code I ran on Processing:</p>

<br></br> 
<p><b>MOVING ELLIPSE</b></p>

<p>float x = 100;</p>
<p>float y = 100;</p>
<p>float speed = 10;</p>
<br></br> 
<p>void setup() {</p>
<p>  size(640, 460);</p>
<p>smooth ();</p>

<p>} </p>
<br></br> 

<p>void draw(){</p>
 <p> background (0);</p>
 <p> ellipse (x, y, 40, 40);</p>
 <p> x = x + speed;</p>
 <p> float speed = 10;</p>

<p>} </p>
<br></br> 


 <p><b>THE PORT, WHERE IS MY PORT?</b></p>

 <p>It was now time to load my sensor data on to Processing. 

 To find out the name of my serial port, I listed all serial connections on Terminal: </p>

 <p>To get the list, just type</p>

<p>ls /dev/tty.*</p>

<img src="images/port_list.png">
 	<br></br> 

<p>You can use the terminal command SCREEN for connecting to serial consoles.</p>

 <p>If you know the serial port, you can just type "screen portname datarate" to show the serial data on the screen. In my case, it was:</p>

<p>screen /dev/tty.usbmodem411 9600</p>

<p>Once I knew my port name, I tried using several examples to see the sensor's data, but it simply wouldn't connect.</p>

 <p>I knew nothing was wrong with the sensor, as I could see accurate readings with my sketch on the Arduino IDE.</p>

 	<br></br> 

 <p>After many hours of struggle, Processing finally accepted to read my sonar-measured distances. Turns out, it only likes to handle numbers, so when I went back to my arduino sketch and removed the commands that added "cm" at the end of each line and the "out of range" sentence, it started to work. </p>

 <p>I used basic commands to ask Processing to draw an ellipse that would turn bigger or smaller according to the distance read. </p>


  <p>Here is the code I used: <p>
