       <h3>week 6: electronics design</h3>
      


<h2><b>Leds & Buttons</b></h2>
<br></br>

  <div class="container"> 


<p>This week, our task was to redraw and produce the echo hello-world circuit board, adding a button and a LED to it. Knowing little about electronics and having never used Eagle before, I was bracing myself for a long circuit design nightmare.</p>

<p>To get a gist of the software, I started by watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4DYztYB6d4">video tutorial.
 </a>  </p>

<p>And then I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4DYztYB6d4">this one </a> to better understand how the schematic design works.</p>

<p>During the whole board design process, I kept checking <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/2012/labs/providence/tutorials/07.html">providence tutorials</a>, they proved quite useful.</p>

<p>I downloaded the fab library and picked out the components to place on the schematic board. Then I routed the components and adjusted the components' positions on the layout board.</p>

<p>Once everything seemed to be in the right place, I checked Eagle's Design Rules (under DRC in the Tools Menu), to see if there were any warnings or errors. And helas, there were quite a few overlaps and improperly connected routes. It took a little more editing before my board was compliant with the rules, but I finally succeeded.</p> 

<p>Here are the schematic and layout views of the board:</p>

<br></br>

<p>I then exported the board layout as a .png, and edited in Gimp to add the outline traces. I also exported an image of the pads alone, so I could use it as a stencil to evenly apply soldering paste on the board.</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>PCB AND STENCIL MAKING</p></b>

I uploaded my circuit's .png image into the fabmodules, so I could cut out my copper board in the Modela. I followed the same steps from the <a href="week4.html" alt=>Electronics Production week </a>and the process was fast and painless. </p>

<img src="images/milling_pcb.jpg">
<br></br>

This is how the PCB looked after being milled. I noticed at this point that the pads for one of my 10k resistors were much smaller than all the other ones. I imagine I must have accidently used the wrong library on Eagle when I selected it. Fingers crossed, I would be able to solder my component on the mini pads without a problem.

<br></br>

<p>After cleaning up the board (soap, water, steelwool), I noticed the mill bit had "eaten" quite a deep path between my traces. This is not ideal when you are using stencils -- you want you surface to be as flat and even as possible, so that the solder paste doesn't bleed underneath. </p>

<p>Cutting out the board's pads in the Roland vinyl cutter was a very simple operation: I turned my Eagle image into a vector in Inkscape (you can even do the tracing directly in CUTSTUDIO, the not-so-great-software that comes with the machine), took a small leftover piece of vinyl and the machine took care of the rest in just a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>This is how the vinyl mask looked, after being glued on to the circuit board</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>SOLDERING PASTE</p></b>

<p>I then started applying the solder paste onto the mask. I'm not convinced I chose the most effective method to spread it out evenly among the pads; instead of applying bits and pieces directly on the holes, I think it works best if one applies a thick line of paste on of the the board's edges and then spreads it back and forth until all the pad holes are filled. </p> 

<p>Here's a closer look at the process:</p>

<br></br>

<p>As I removed the mask, most of the solder paste was right on the pads; but the smaller  Attiny44 pads were somewhat flooded in paste, so I cleaned up the paths between them with an exacto knife and a needle. </p>

<p>ADDING THE COMPONENTS</p>

<p>Once the excess solder paste was removed, it was time to lay out the components on the pasted pads. I started by printing out a big-sized image of my board layout; this was to serve as a "bingo board" on which I could place the components, as I was picking them out of the fabinventory. This helped me keep track of all the micro parts. </p>

<br></br>

<p>Once all the components were on the board, I was ready for the heat gun! </p>

<img src="images/components_on_paste.jpg">
<br></br>

<p>Working the heatgun (set to 340ÂºC) slolwly around the board and watchin the solder paste turn into a nice shinny metal was actually quite entertaining. I pointed the gun diretly at the individual pads I was looking to solder (at a distance of about 2-5cms) and kept making sure I was not overheating the cirtcuit -- and risk frying some of the components.</p>

<br></br>

<p>This is how the board looked after going through the heating process:</p>

<p><b>CONNECTING THE CIRCUIT</p></b>

<p>After checking all the connections on the board with the voltmeter, I connected it to the ISP and to the FTDI cable. To make sure the connecting cables were all in the "right position", I used the voltmeter to look for the ground pins on both the Attiny and the FTDI header and this helped me align them.</p>

<p>This is the look of the helloecho board, once connected to the ISP and the FTDI cable.</p>

<p>I didn't have enough time to start programming my board this week, so I'm still waiting to say hello to the world...</p>
   

<p>Here are the board's Eagle files:</p>
