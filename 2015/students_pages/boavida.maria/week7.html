       <h3>week 7: embedded programming</h3>
      


<p>This week we were to program our circuit board and turn on its LED when clicking on the button.</p>

I decided to do this by using the Arduino IDE -- "it's easy and user friendly", I was told, and that's what I was looking to hear.

<p>To get a first look at the Arduino IDE,  I started by watching this <a href="http://www.jeremyblum.com/2011/01/02/arduino-tutorial-series-it-begins"/>video tutorial.</p>
 </a>  </p>

<p>And then I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4DYztYB6d4">this one </a> to better understand what is behind the LED+button task.</p>

<p>Most of the arduino programming magic seems to be behind two commands "setup" and "loop".</p> 


<p>I took some time to play around with the arduino UNO breadboard (despite the fact that Neil doensn't recommend breadboards). I wanted to understand the physical effects of my changes in the code and the breadboard makes this quite easy and immediate. I plugged a LED and a button on to the breadboard and got my button code from the IDE's library.</p>

<p>Once I got it to work on the breadboard, I was ready to take that code to my circuit board.</p> 



<p><b>INSTALLING THE ATTINY SUPPORT</p></b>

<p>To do this, my first task was to put the arduino IDE in communication with my board's Attiny micro-processor.</p> 

<p>I followed the <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/2012/labs/providence/tutorials/09.html">providence tutorial </a>  to install Attiny support into the Arduino IDE (create hardware folder in Arduino docs, paste attiny folders to it). The links to the attiny on that page were no longer working, so I found the most updated zip files on <a href="ttp://highlowtech.org/?p=1695 ">this page </a>. After adding these files to my hardware folder, I could now see the Attiny boards in the menu Tools>Boards.</p>
