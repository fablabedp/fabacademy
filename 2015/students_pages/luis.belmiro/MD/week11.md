###How output?

This is a fine week, will be the opening of my [Fablab at Penela](www.fablabpenela.com). 
But in this sense of output i decided to rebuild an old board from my Fablab. I do it because this our's ways to fabricate boards it's awesome easy and powerfull.

This old board, made in proto board, have a 3 hours of production time for each board.
I expect that with Fablab way i could produce it in about 30 minutes, with no error's. 

###Output a Crib.

This board is made for connect an Raspberry to a arduino pro mini and from them to 6 servo motor's. 

That servo motor's control animated figures in a Christmas Crib. 
That Crib have:
- 100 figure's.
- 40.000 visitor's.
- All figures are 3D printed.
- All have been produced in 2 months time.
- The exposition have been open for one month.

And all of this with no open Fablab. :)

###New board, new challenge's
First challenge is to rebuild an Arduino, but with the possibility in use it as controller board.

So i go find the Fabkit from satshakit :)

I name it RaspFabDriverServo.

In that board i have an logic level bidirectional from Sparkfun design. 
I use it to the Raspberry could program the Arduino. :)

###Whoooo a new board
But... wait i not gone do an arduino [fabkit](http://www.fabacademy.org/archives/2015/doc/projects/satshakit/satshakit.html).  I will do an fabkit shield. Great :)

I must do all my design again, but no worries, it's the best so it's cool :)

Work in progress.
