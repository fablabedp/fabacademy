###Composite myself

This week i will try to cast myself from composite shape.
I think this because, i fine way to demonstrate the 3D scanning and printing in may [Fablab](www.fablabpenela.com) was 3D scanning people and print them.
So how can i show the power and the simplicity of the composites week to the people and to myself :)

When i have been in Fab10 Jordi Mart√≠n from [makersandbits.com](http://makersandbits.com) have scan myself and here was the [result](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u03jpnszskryg6k/Miro%20in%203D.ply?dl=0).

When i have my first 3d Printer [Beeverycreative](https://beeverycreative.com/) i print myself and i show the possibilities to the mayor of my town and it was incredibel, he goes from office to office for all building showing it.

So i cut myself :) in [NetFabbBasic](http://www.netfabb.com/downloadcenter.php?basic=1) because it is very easy to cut stl.

Then in use [meshmixer](http://www.meshmixer.com/) to make an offset of the face like a second skin with 1mm offset.
I use *Make solid* command.

###Machining time

So whith the 3D file i can go to the [Aspire](http://www.vectric.com/products/aspire.html) and to the [Ouplan](http://ouplan.pt/) machine to play with it. :)

###Composite time

For this part i use this [epoxy](https://entropyresins.com/product/super-sap-ccr-clear-casting-epoxy-resin/). Is a clear cast one. 
I mix them with the ardner like says the [datasheet](https://entropyresins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/TDS-CCR-Epoxy.pdf)

Then it's just apply.
