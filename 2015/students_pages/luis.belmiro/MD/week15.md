      what will it do?
      who's done what beforehand?
      what materials and components will be required?
      where will they come from?
      how much will it cost?
      what parts and systems will be made?
      what processes will be used?
      what tasks need to be completed?

###Personal FabFarm
This will be a plataform that combines the electronics, furniture and a web portal like github where the project's resides. 

The ambition is:
every Varanda with a box. 
The box have plant's growing
The box have electronic's that measure data
The electronic's control's irregition temperature and ligth. 
All data go to a web portal
From the webportal we can interact with the culture. 
All data is online and free recipes of how to grow thing's will be spread in the internet.

Personal FabFarm? Why?
- It's a possible dream. 
- We make trash and from that trash we can grab food.
- First we need a [composter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost)
- Than we close the circule. with FabFarm. :)
- This is a smal step in direction of [Data in Data out.:)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bko43fBOnDo)
- And another step to [circular economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_sw0dK0JVs). 

###what will it do?
A struture that have soil on it. 
In teh soil:
plants. 
irrigation system - try to build it with rain water system
sensor to mesure the moistre.
temperature sensor
light sensor
Electronic FabKit conect to the internet.
This is a automated farm.
  
###who's done what beforehand?
Here are some link's to sites of people that do that. 
But what i want is something so easy to build, operate that could be passionate to the people.
      
###what materials and components will be required?
Wood for the struture
Acrilic to the some wall's.
 Irregation pipes.
