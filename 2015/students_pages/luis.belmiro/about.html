            <hr>

            I'm a soon of a farmer, but early in my growth i become in love by electronics.
            I have studied milk indutry in my sennior high school.
            But after that i go to Leiria to an polytechnic school where i study Electronic's.
            <p> 
            After that i was working in mold industry, making electronics to increase prodution os the molding machines.<p>
            Again i change in my carrer, i went to the dental indutry, again making electronic's to the dental chair's.
            Here, i made my first dental imaging software. The software aquires x-ray images from the thooth with some fpga kit. And again the software treat the image and archive them in a database.
            <p>
            2008 i married and i back to my village Penela, from there i become worker to another software dental company called <a href="http://www.imaginasoft.pt/">Imaginasoft</a>, there i made my second dental imaging software.<p></p>
            2012 the crissis strike Portugal, and dental industry and i lost my job.<p></p>
            Well... Here the adventure begins. 
            <P></P>
            I that year have born my second child Maria, i start study, software engeneer in colage.<p></p>
            But...<p></p>
            I droped colege. Why?! The method's of teaching are to stiff and old. 
            I go to a corwk space where i could learn by my self, Arduino, Raspberry, Node JS, PHP.
            After that an oportunity appers to make a big project in tourism area. <p></p>
            I try to find a team, and yes i could. <p></p>
            I find it, in the <a href="http://crossinganswers.com/">Crossing Answers</a>. <p></p>
            They have made an "ulock tabaco machine electronics" with the national identification card. 
            I made for them the electronics.
            <p></p>
            And with them, my beloved team, we made:<p></p>
            - An AudioGuide based in an App (Android and IOS)<p></p>
            - Turistic tracking App<p></p>
            - Virtual visiting system (You could visit Penela Castel with Oculus rift Glasses) <p></p>
            - Aumented reality binoculars. <p></p>
            - And mutch more.<p></p>
<p></p>
            In that enterprise i'm in charge of the Fablab Penela managment. 
            I love it every bit.
<p></p>
            The big thing we did at Fablab Penela was make an 100 animated pupets (with arduino and raspberry), in a crib cene, with 500 m<sup>2</sup>, and where we have been visited by 40 000 people.
<p></p>
            Weel this is me at Work, 
            <p></p>
            But i'm more:<p></p>
            Boy scout chief<p></p>
            Invicted teatcher in <a href="http://www.isec.pt/">ISEC </a><p></p>
            Active member of an organization that promotes formation in personal development.
<p></p>
            In my free time i play with mi Kinds, that and be with my wife are the propous of my life, they are the frist ones in everything :)
<p></p>
            Why Fabacademy:
            I run a Fablab, i think i could learn from the best's<p></p>
            Fabacademy is network, and is this new world, network is knoladge.<p></p>
            We at Fablab Penela like to give Fabacademy in the next year.<p></p>
