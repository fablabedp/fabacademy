                        This week we have been invited to play around with all technology's in Design. 
                        First i begin to design my final project in windows paint, Krita, MyPaint and Gimp.
                        I have tried the tablet table and monitor wacom HD13. 
                        After install it, in windows 8 64bits, i find a bug in software's Krita and MyPaint. 
                        The pointer have an offset from the point where the pencil are.
                        So i paint it in Windows Paint. 
                        And after thart in Gimp. 
                        The result's are shown above 

                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Vector image software</h2>    
                        <p></p>
                        After playing with Raster, i try vectorial software, InkScape.

                        I install easaly inkscape in my mac, but i have need to install X11 also.
                        Inkscape is ok for me, i'm an engenieer so i strougle a bit with design ;)
                        Inkscape in my mac sometimes from nowhere break and close, but i keep it save all 10 minutes.

                        I strougle a bit with some comand's like clip. 
                        A the first i try to remove a part from an object but what i need to do is the inverse. 
                        So i do it. 
                        Designing in Inkscape was great because confront me with real measurs and i nedd to be conscient of the how my project will be made.

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">3D image software</h2>        
                        <p></p>
                        I try to use Rhino, I have use it once before to build a part to my car that have been broken. And after i had printed that part.

                        I this case i try to figure out more what Rhino is and can do. 
                        Fist of all i made a concept sketch of my final project. 
                        I learn how to put Words in a circle. 
                        It is simple after i figure how it is done, and after that i play around with cicle's radio's and another letter caracteristic's
                        I learn also how to put materials in my design. 
                        I do it easaly and i intent to make my sketch rendered :)
                        I will gona try to install in mac the Groshopper.
                        For that and because i have a mac i need to install a virtual machine.
                        I Use virtualbox and windows xp.
